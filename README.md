# Explainable AI for Credit Risk Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of an Explainable AI (XAI) framework for predicting and interpreting credit risk decisions.  
The goal is to combine **predictive accuracy** with **transparent, actionable explanations** that support regulatory compliance, fairness, and trust in automated lending decisions.

---

## Objectives
- Predict the probability of default (PD) for loan applicants.
- Provide **global explanations** (feature importance at the model level) and **local explanations** (decision reasoning for individual applicants).
- Ensure compliance with financial regulations (e.g., Basel III, GDPR “Right to Explanation”).
- Mitigate bias and promote fairness in credit scoring.

---

## Data
- **Source:** [Specify dataset source: internal bank data, public credit dataset, etc.]
- **Size & Period:** [e.g., 500k applicants, 2018–2023]
- **Features:** Financial ratios, credit history metrics, behavioral indicators, demographic variables (with fairness considerations).
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value imputation, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables.
- **Bias Mitigation:** [Outline methods used, e.g., reweighing, disparate impact analysis.]

---

## Model Architecture
- Predictive Model(s): [e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression]
- Rationale for Model Choice: Balances accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.
- Hyperparameters: See `config/` directory.

---

## Explainability Methods
- **Global Explanations:** SHAP summary plots, feature importance rankings.
- **Local Explanations:** SHAP force plots, LIME explanations, counterfactual examples.
- **Surrogate Models:** Decision trees for interpretable approximations of complex models.
- **Intended Users:** Credit analysts, compliance officers, end-customers.

---

## Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics:** AUC, F1-score, precision, recall.
- **Explanation Metrics:** Fidelity, stability, comprehensibility, actionability.
- **User Studies:** Feedback from domain experts (if applicable).
- **Example Outputs:** See `examples/` directory for sample explanations.

---

## Ethical & Regulatory Compliance
- Adheres to **GDPR** and **Basel III** transparency requirements.
- Implements bias detection and mitigation workflows.
- Provides clear, user-understandable reasons for credit decisions.
